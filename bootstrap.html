    <p style="text-align: justify; color: white; font-size: 120%; border: 2px solid black;">Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.It produces less cross-browser bugs.It is a consistent framework supported by all the browsers plus CSS based compatibility fixes. It is a lightweight and hence widely used framework for creating responsive sites.Looks, structure, and styles can be customized as per requirement.A simple and effective grid system.</p>
